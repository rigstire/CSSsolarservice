The test revealed that dirty panels produced just 145 Watts of energy. After cleaning, the output increased to 183 Watts, showing a remarkable 26% increase in energy efficiency! This experiment underscores the importance of cleaning your panels to boost solar energy production. Watch the full comparison in the video below."}
